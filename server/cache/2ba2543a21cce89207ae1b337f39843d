<Overview>Dragon Ball Z Abridged is the title of TeamFourStar's abridged series based on the Dragon Ball Z anime. This abridged series is one of the most successful series created in '08-'09 and was featured on That Guy with The Glasses official website.

Dragon Ball Z Abridged is a direct parody with most characters and plot lines remaining relatively unchanged. Origins of concepts and names within the series often alternate between the FUNimation Dub, and the original Japanese version. For example, the character Tien is sometimes referred to as Tenshinhan, which is his name in the Japanese dub. Some original attack-names are preserved as well, such as Tien's "Ki-Ko-Ho," instead of "Tri-beam."</Overview>
