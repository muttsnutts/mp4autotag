  <Overview>Dragon Ball Z Abridged is the title of TeamFourStar's abridged series based on the Dragon Ball Z anime. This abridged series is one of the most successful series created in '08-'09 and was featured on That Guy with The Glasses official website.

Dragon Ball Z Abridged is a direct parody with most characters and plot lines remaining relatively unchanged. Origins of concepts and names within the series often alternate between the FUNimation Dub, and the original Japanese version. For example, the character Tien is sometimes referred to as Tenshinhan, which is his name in the Japanese dub. Some original attack-names are preserved as well, such as Tien's &quot;Ki-Ko-Ho,&quot; instead of &quot;Tri-beam.&quot;</Overview>

  <Overview>The episode opens on a peaceful farm when a spacepod crashes down onto Earth into a farmer's marijuana patch. A humanoid alien emerges from the pod and the farmer fires at him, only for his bullet to be caught and flicked back at him, killing him. The alien commands the farmer to get up and apologise only to be disappointed at how easily he killed him and realizes this is why his father would not allow him to keep Appule.

After the opening we cut to a lonely Piccolo checking his Myspace, only to find he has no new comments or friend requests. Piccolo is interupted by the alien, who confused him for someone named &quot;Kakarot&quot; which leads to Piccolo pointing out his green skin, pointy ears, and turban and sarcasticly stating he looks like so many other people. The alien, who doesn't appreciate Piccolo's sarcasm, decides to use his special attack known as Keep Your Eye on the Birdy (move was originally called Double Sunday until Vegeta3986 interupted Lanipator and fought with him over the mic). Before he can perform his attack, his scouter alerts him of a higher power level, and he leaves.

At Kame House, Master Roshi and Krillin (along with Turtle and Oolong) wait for their friends, whom they haven't seen in years. When Bulma arrives she explains that Yamcha didn't show up because he was caught cheating. Goku arrives shortly after, and they all confuse Goku's son, Gohan, to be some kid he ran off with in the wood until Goku explains that Gohan is his son. They ask what Gohan is going to be and Goku explains that ChiChi wants Gohan to be what he calls &quot;lame&quot; when he grows up. Bulma asks about the dragon ball on Gohan's hat, questioning wether it would make him a target for enemies that want the dragon balls. Just as Goku states that he can fight off anyone, the alien arrives and explains to Goku that he is actually part of an alien race called the Saiyans and that they are brothers. Raditz, the Saiyan, offers Goku to join him and destroy everyone on the planet. When Goku disagrees, Raditz knees Goku in the stomach, takes Gohan and flies away. Afterwards Piccolo arrives to laugh at Goku's loss. Goku offers that if Piccolo helps get him back, he will friend him on Myspace. The episode ends with Piccolo and Goku heading towards Raditz.

Eyecatch: Master Roshi holds up more items that change, from a Nestle Crunch Bar, to a gummy bear, finishing with Nappa's head. </Overview>

  <Overview>The episode opens with Piccolo and Goku flying to Radditz's location. Goku asks if his green skin and being hatched from an eggs means he's a Yoshi. Piccolo sarcasticly says yes. Goku, not realizing the sarcasm, asks if he may ride Piccolo.

After the credits, Radditz is angrily screaming at Gohan to stop crying. Seeing that his angrily screaming does not help, he tosses Gohan in the pod. As he is about to rest, Piccolo and Goku show up and challenge him to a fight. After he notices they are getting stronger from removing clothing, he begins to get naked until Goku informs him that they are just wearing weighted clothing. Radditz, embarassed and angered, attacks Piccolo and Goku. After failing to land a hit on Radditz, he finally launches two energy blasts at them, missing Goku and hitting Piccolo. Goku taunts Radditz for missing him just to be kicked by Radditz. When Goku gets up, he offers Piccolo a high five before noticing he lost his arm, just congratulating him with a good job. Piccolo informs Goku that he has good news and bad news. Good news being he has an attack that he can use with just one arm, bad news is Goku has to hold him off for 5 minutes despite Radditz beating both of them in under one. Goku attacks Radditz with confidence only to be beaten until Goku grabs his tail twice, both times being convinced that Radditz is truly sorry and lets go. Radditz knocks him down and stomps on Goku, damaging his ribs. Gohan, who is angered at Radditz for beating his father, breaks free from the pod and headbutts Radditz which wounds him badly. Radditz attacks Gohan (TFS states they do not condone child violence, yet they find it hilarious) and knocks him out. When Radditz is going to kill Gohan, Goku performs a full nelson on Radditz and tells Piccolo to give a signal before firing the beam. Instead, Piccolo just launches his Special Beam Cannon (he originally attemps to say the Japanese name but fails to pronounce it) and impales them both. Krillin, Roshi, and Bulma arrive to help only to notice that Goku has been killed. Krillin offers Goku a senzu bean, but Goku dies shortly after. Krillin is happy that he is not the first person to die in the series. Piccolo then grows his arm back and flies off with Gohan.

Eyecatch: The eyecatch is Goku ordering Gohan to do a headbutt, which parodies a Pokemon game by saying his headbutt was super-effective. </Overview>

  <Overview>This episode opens with Roshi commenting that Goku has stopped a great evil, only to be interruped by Nappa and Vegeta over Raddit'z scouter. They overhear them talk about plans to come to Earth, use the dragon balls to wish for immortality, kill everyone, and that they will be there in a year or so.

Afterwards, Piccolo is telling Gohan that he will train him and use him to aid him in his conquest to take over the world. When Gohan asks where his father he, Piccolo repeats that he is dead and laughs at him, causing Gohan to cry.

Meanwhile, in the check-in station to Heaven, Kami is trying to convince Yemma to let Goku travel on Snakeway to King Kai's planet to recieve training to battle the Saiyans coming to Earth. After talking about the mahogany his desk is made of, he agrees to let Goku go through to Snakeway, but before Goku leaves he asks if he has seen Radditz. Yemma explains that he put him in his Yemma Lock only for him to kick him in the balls and run away, cutting to Radditz saying he didn't keep his eye on the birdy.

At Kame's house, when asked how Chichi took the news, Krillin lies and says it went well. Bulma ask him to gather the Z-Warriors to go train on Kami's lookout. When Krillin comments on how stupid the Z-Warriors sounds, Chichi comes and demands to know where Krillin is. Krillin runs off in fear looking for the Z-Warriors. Meanwhile, Piccolo informs Gohan that he will be put through his training.

Piccolo calls Gohan a nerd when he talks about how someone his age going through that training would not be good for him. Piccolo then throws Gohan at a mountain, hoping to unlock his full potential. Unfortunately, Gohan just hits the rock and begins crying, with Piccolo commenting that it will be a long training session.

Finally, at the start of Snakeway, one of the demons is telling Goku about the trip and warns him not to fall off or he will go straight to Hell. When asked if anyone ever made it, the man says a name, but we cut off to Kami informing Mr. Popo about the new trainees. The episode closes with Popo doing his creepy chuckle.

Eyecatch: Yemma talks more about his mahogany, saying that it is from the planet of Malchior 7 and comes from trees that are 300 feet tall and breath fire and that his desk was forged 2000 through a blood ritual and that it is indestructable and can bend the fabrics of reality itself. Also that it is an expensive material. </Overview>

  <Overview>Goku finally reaches the end of Snake Way and jumps over to King Kai's planet. He falls on the ground and King Kai sarcastically comments &quot;Nice job, jackass.&quot;

After the opening, Nappa is constantly asking Vegeta if they're on Earth yet and they decide to stop on the bug planet called Arlia to keep Nappa busy. The Arlians show up and throw them in jail, where Nappa warns Vegeta not to drop the soap to which Vegeta replies with a threat to shiv him.

Goku meets King Kai and he explains why the gravity is so heavy. When he explains that it's because his planet is smaller than Earth, Gregory comments on it not making any sense and King Kai says it is because there is an evil space pirate named Bojack locked inside of his planet. King Kai agrees to train Goku because the only company he's had for the last 500 years are Bubbles, Gregory, and Bojack. Goku agrees that nothing is more boring when it cuts to Namek, as Nail complains that it is so incredibly boring and he wishes something exciting would happen after Guru tells him he saw a fish.

Back on Arlia, Vegeta is turned into a prison bitch by one of the imprisoned Arlian. They break out of jail and introduce themselves to the Arlian King. Vegeta is about to kill them when Nappa demands that he mate with his queen. He explains he doesn't have to listen to them and summons his 10 elite guards only to be destroyed by Nappa. After seeing what they can do, he agrees to breed with his wife and Nappa takes a picture and sends it to Vegeta.

Back on Earth, Piccolo begins his training with Gohan. Gohan asks what he will learn today and after many guesses, Piccolo yells &quot;NERD!&quot; and strikes Gohan.

After refusing to leave, The Arlian King summons his Rancor to destroy the Saiyans. Nappa begs Vegeta to keep it and after Vegeta says yes, Nappa plays with it only to accidentally destroy it. Vegeta sends a rock flying into the king's stomach, killing him. When he sees Nappa cuddling the dead Arlian Rancor, Vegeta informs him that it is dead. After being declared heros by one of the freed Arlians, Vegeta destroys the planet and they continue their trip to Earth. </Overview>

  <Overview>Mr. Popo takes the Z-Fighters and teleports them to another dimension. Meanwhile, King Kai promises Goku that he will commence their training. Goku decides his first lesson is to catch Bubbles and begins chasing him. King Kai had another idea in mind, but just allows Goku to continue chasing Bubbles.

We cut back to the Z-Fighters who are walking through a destroyed area full of dead Saiyans. Krillin makes a comment on being in New Orleans to which Tien replies to it being &quot;too soon.&quot; Chiaotzu is then attacked by a Saiyan. Yamcha and Tien argue and are interrupted by the evil Saiyans giving a speech of how evil they are. Krillin is pulled underground and destroyed by the Saiyans. When they avenge Chiaotzu, they are killed by the evil Saiyans as Popo laughs at their defeat. They return to the pendulem room to hear Popo congratulate them on passing the first test, but he sends them back. Kami asks where they sent them and Popo replies with &quot;I'll tell you where they're not: safe.&quot;

After Goku catches Bubbles, he decides to attack Gregory and runs around attempting to smash him with a hammer. Goku asks to hear about the Saiyans and King Kai goes to Wikipedia to look up how Planet Vegeta was destoyed and finds they were hit by falling rocks and &quot;P.S. Frieza rules you.&quot; Goku wants to continue his training and it cuts to Roshi's Island. They summon Shenron, the magical dragon. Shenron is frustrated to see that it is the Z-Fighters to summon him. Roshi explains that he wishes Goku back to life. Shenron grants this wish and Goku comes back to life when King Kai explains that he learned Kaioken and Spirit Bomb off screen. King Kai orders him to leave and is dissapointed to be stuck with Bubbles, Gregory, and Bojack again. </Overview>

  <Overview>Nappa is asking Vegeta if they are there yet again and Vegeta finally says yes. They land on Earth, to which Nappa replies with &quot;Yayyy!&quot; They exit their pods and land on the ground. When asks if they're aliens, Nappa destroys the entire city. Vegeta gets onto Nappa for possibly destroying a dragon ball. They fly off to find the strongest power level.

It cuts to Gohan and Piccolo, as the latter senses the Saiyans coming towards them. Krillin arrives and asks about the training with Piccolo. Gohan asks the same to Krillin and cries when he thinks of Popo's training. The Saiyans arrive and the Z-Fighters asks them questions, to which Nappa all replies with &quot;No&quot; and explains that Vegeta was a prison bitch. Nappa points out that Piccolo is a Namekian and that he does not have a penis, causing Krillin to laugh at him. Gohan questions if he is a plant, to which Nappa and Piccolo call him a nerd. Nappa reads their power levels but Vegeta explains that they can hide their power levels. Vegeta decides to plant the Saibamen and Nappa plants seeds and grows them out of the ground, comparing them to Radditz. Tien and Chiaotzu arrive. Nappa notices and confuses Chiaotzu as a Pokémon. Yamcha arrives shortly after and gives a motivating speech about winning the battle, when a Saibaman grabs onto him and self-destructs, causing his death. </Overview>

  <Overview>The episode opens to the gang at Kame House watching the fight on TV and sees that Yamcha has been killed, causing Bulma to cry and admit she was saving herself for him to which Roshi replies &quot;bull sh**.&quot;

Back at the battle field, an angered Krillin promises to avenge Yamcha only to be made fun of for being weak. He destroys 3 of the Saibamen, leaving one for Piccolo to destroy. Everyone congratulates Piccolo and ignores Krillin for killing 3 of them. Nappa steps onto the battle field and attack Tien, removing his hand. Tien escapes, making Nappa think he wants to play tag. Chiaotzu hops onto Nappa's back and uses self-destruct. Chiaotzu's death was in vain, as Nappa has barely a scratch on him. Nappa attacks Tien and begs for help. Krillin and Piccolo join in and knock Nappa towards Gohan, who becomes too scared (because Piccolo said &quot;NERD&quot;) to attack and runs away. Krillin asks if Piccolo has a plan. Piccolo says that he has 2 plans; either Krillin gets him in a full nelson or they use the multi-form technique. They attack Nappa, who confuses this as a game of pattycake. He knocks all of them back into one form and claims his throne as the pattycake champion. Tien uses a final attack on Nappa, using up all of his energy and causing his death. Nappa is still alive and charges towards Piccolo and Krillin, only to stop and realize he can fly. Krillin threatens that Goku will arrive and defeat them all, making Nappa curious to meet him and wants to put the fight on hold until Goku arrives. Vegeta gives them 3 hours. Nappa gets bored and keeps asking if he's here, they all get annoyed and Vegeta demands he goes to find something to do. Nappa goes to blow up an entire navy army and their battleships. Vegeta's timer goes off and Nappa arrives, without his armor. </Overview>

  <Overview>The episode opens with Gohan attempting to wake up Piccolo, who was knocked unconcious by Nappa in the previous episode. Krillin assures Gohan that his father, Goku will arrive, citing that he's never let them down, but then it cuts to Goku back at Princess Snake's palace eating another huge meal. Snake reminds him that there was something he had to do about Saiyans. Realizing his negligence, Goku rushes right back on Snake Way and continues his way back to Earth.

After the credits, Nappa attacks Gohan and knocks him unconcious as well, leaving only Krillin to fight Nappa. Nappa charges towards Krillin, who, in a moment of desperation, tells him it's his turn to attack, to which Nappa stops instantly. Vegeta questions Nappa's actions, who claims that it is Krillin's turn to attack and that he has to wait for him, causing Vegeta to nosebleed from Nappa's stupidity. Vegeta than begins to chant &quot;Nine minutes, eighteen seconds&quot; and says that will be the happiest moment of his life. Krillin, angry for not being taken more seriously, prepares his new attack, sheepishly admitting he could have used it earlier to save his friends' lives and proclaims it as his &quot;Destructo Disc&quot; (Which Piccolo, in a subconscious state of mind, denounces as &quot;Lame&quot;), throwing it straight at Nappa. Nappa mistakes it for a frisbee, while Vegeta tries to warn him not to fall for such a trick, to which Nappa, randomly, replies that &quot;Tricks are for Kids&quot;. Irked yet again by his partner's stupidity, Vegeta instead instructs him to catch it with his teeth. Nappa cheerfully tries so, but the disc just scars his face (And cuts off the top half of a plateau that a mountain climber was yodeling on), ruining Nappa's modeling career as a result. Angered by this, Nappa launches an energy ball at Krillin that leaves him crippled. Just before he delivers the finishing blow, he is struck in the back by Piccolo. Piccolo makes threats to Nappa only to be cut off by Gohan kicking Nappa into a mountain. Nappa hops out, furious at Gohan and launches his fire ball. Piccolo jumps in front of the way and shields Gohan from the attack, realizing just before it's too late that he could just grab Gohan and get clear of the attack, and dies in the process, asking why he didn't dodge one final time. Kami also dies and fades away, telling Mr. Popo he has to go to Namek and get the dragon balls to bring him back to life. Gohan is about to be stomped on but is stopped by the Nimbus Cloud picking up Gohan. Goku arrives and gives Senzu Beans to Krillin and Gohan. Nappa asks for the power level and Vegeta replies that it is 6. Nappa attacks Goku and is beaten to a pulp. Vegeta reveals his scouter was upside down and that it is over 9,000. Goku informs them that the dragon balls don't work because Nappa killed Piccolo. Vegeta is angered and destroys Nappa (Precisely at 9:18 echoing his earlier &quot;prophecy&quot;), leaving a smile on his face. </Overview>

  <Overview>Vegeta's completely overjoyed with his childish, idiotic partner finally dead. However, he still intends to kill everyone on Earth, including Goku and his friends. Goku decides to face Vegeta on his own and instructs Gohan and Krillin to get as far away from the battlefield as possible (Which Krillin does without a moment of hesitation). Before parting ways, Gohan asks Goku if he has any messages to relay to Chichi, which is for her to put dinner on because he (Goku) is hungry.

Goku then requests that he and Vegeta take their fight elsewhere, since fighting on a battleground littered with the corpses of his fallen friends just doesn't feel right to Goku. Relocating to a desert, Goku gives Vegeta one opportunity to leave Earth and never return so no more blood needs to be shed before their fight begins. Vegeta disregards Goku's offer as tripe and belittles him for growing soft from living on the planet for so long. Vegeta's criticism is met with a Kaioken punch to the face by Goku, but he quickly counters this and proceeds to beat Goku. Vegeta then suggests Goku just gives up now, but is then met with an even more powerful punch to the face from Goku, this time with the Kaioken times 3. Vegeta is sent flying into a plateau, and tries to shake off the pain, sarcastically claiming to be surrounded by gumdrops and ice cream inside the plateau's indentation when Goku asks if he's okay. Not seeing the sarcasm in Vegeta's response, Goku asks if he can join, but at that moment, Vegeta snaps, destroying the plateau and threatening to obliterate the entire planet. Vegeta fires his Galick Gun, which is held at bay by Goku's Kamehameha wave. After an epic clash, Goku takes the Kaioken to a dangerous 4th level, overpowering Vegeta's Galick Gun and sending him vanishing into the sky.

Back at Kami House, Master Roshi, Bulma, Chichi, Ox King, and Oolong reminisce on the old times when they were out there with our main heroes and made a difference, contrary to what they do now, just watching from the sidelines.

Somewhere above the clouds of Earth, Vegeta gets off of the Kamahemaha beam and rages at having been surpassed by Goku. He does have another plan, however, which is to become the mighty Oozary and crush Goku for good. However, thanks to Piccolo, the Earth no longer has a moon which Vegeta needs for his Oozaru transformation. Anticipating this, Vegeta instead returns to Goku and presents an artificial moon that supplies the necessary resource needed for Vegeta to transform (Which Goku mistakes for cheese, further bemusing Vegeta). Vegeta throws the artificial moon into the air and begins transforming.

Finding that even at the size of a giant ape Vegeta is still as fast as ever, Goku desperately thinks up a plan, which is to &quot;think like a monkey&quot;. In the process, he is contacted by King Kai to instead use the spirit bomb to defeat Vegeta. He begins gathering the energy he needs, but forgets to remain well hidden from the Saiyan ape, getting pummeled into the ground instantly... </Overview>

  <Overview>After Zarbon's lifeless corpse falls into a lake, Krillin and Vegeta make small talk before Vegeta demands the handover of their Dragon Ball, allowing him to possess all seven. Knowing he can't beat Vegeta, Krillin hands it over. Vegeta decides to spare Krillin and Bulma before flying off. Bulma yells at Krillin for just letting it go like that, setting Krillin off. He goes into a tirade about how much of a bitch Bulma is.

Vegeta starts to sing &quot;Don't Stop Me Now&quot; by Queen as he flies to his other Dragon Ball. Little does he know that Gohan is flying his direction with said Dragon Ball, and is also singing the same song. They detect each other, and Gohan hides. After some threats, Gohan emerges, having hidden his Dragon Ball. He passes his Dragon Radar off as an antique pocketwatch. Although Vegeta is suspicious, he talks sweet to Gohan, saying the last of the Saiyans need to look out for each other, saying he can &quot;help&quot; the younger one. Creeped out by Vegeta's demeanor, Gohan says, &quot;I need an adult.&quot; Vegeta responds, &quot;I am an adult.&quot; before kneeing Gohan in the gut. Vegeta says he only did that to take out pent-up frustration held against Goku, then flies off, leaving Gohan and his Dragon Ball.

After he finishes his tirade, Bulma smacks Krillin. Gohan arrives shortly after with his Dragon Ball, and tells the others they need to find a new hiding place; Vegeta will find out that Dragon Ball will be missing shortly. Vegeta goes underwater where he hid his other Dragon Ball, and looks for where he hid it. Unable to find it, he begins to put two and two together, figuring out that Gohan's &quot;watch&quot; was most likely a Dragon Ball locator. Ghost Nappa appears, and tells Vegeta that Gohan took the Dragon Ball. Vegeta explodes out of the lake, letting out the strongest scream of all time.

It's so strong, not only can Gohan hear it, but Krillin can feel it.

It's so strong, Frieza hears it.

It's so strong, Goku hears it in space, in his spacecraft.

It's so strong, King Yemma hears it in the next world. He thinks it's his estranged wife.

It's so strong, that 20 years later it reaches Earth, where it is heard and recognized by his as-yet-unborn son, Trunks.

&quot;Daddy?&quot;

At their new hiding place, Krillin tells Gohan that he needs to visit Guru, so he can &quot;touch you and pull things out of you that you never knew you had&quot;. Gohan again says he needs an adult. They fly off, to Bulma's chagrin. At his spacecraft, Frieza tries to think of what he will do when he achieves immortality. One of his mooks, Acai, reports that the Ginyu Force will arrive in five minutes. He also says that the remaining officers are unionizing due to the random execution of their ranks. Acai is promptly incinerated. Frieza then thinks of taunting Cooler with his immortality.

As they near Guru's, Gohan and Krillin detect Vegeta getting near. Krillin tells Gohan to go ahead. When he arrives, Guru is annoyed that another human has come to his lookout. Gohan says Krillin said Guru could help him by &quot;touching&quot; him. Guru responds, &quot;Do I look Catholic?&quot; Nail replies he means unlocking his potential. Guru puts his hand on Gohan and describes the process similarly to Krillin's description. Once more, Gohan says, &quot;I need an adult.&quot; Guru begins to unlock his potential.

Outside, Vegeta reaches Krillin, and is so angry he has bloodshot eyes and is mumbling incoherently about needing his Dragon Ball back. He sees Ghost Nappa again, who tells him his rage broke. When Krillin tells Vegeta he doesn't have the Dragon Ball with him, his right eye pops and turns solid red. He approaches Krillin, but the sudden pop of Gohan's power level rise snaps him to his senses. He asks where Nappa is, then is reminded by Krillin that he killed Nappa on Earth. Krillin, in his fear, accidentally spills that Gohan is over at Guru's lookout getting his potential unlocked. Vegeta decides to pay them a beating.

Vegeta gets to the lookout, where he encounters Nail. The two volley insults for a bit, with Nail making fun of Vegeta's height. Guru tells them to stop &quot;making out&quot;. Gohan emerges and tells Vegeta that he is now as strong as his father was when they fought on Earth. Vegeta retorts he's still not as strong as Zarbon or Dodoria. Gohan says he now knows how Krillin feels. Krillin responds, &quot;Sucks, doesn't it?&quot;

Vegeta gloats that, besides Frieza, he is now the strongest being on planet Namek. Guru then tells them there are five extremely strong power levels approaching the planet...and they are all incredibly flamboyant. Vegeta instantly freaks, knowing exactly who he's talking about.

The Ginyu Force has arrived.

In the stinger, Goku reaches into the fridge, and pulls out beer, then &quot;Powerthirst&quot; energy drink, then a jar of Planters nuts (&quot;I can't drink these! These are nuts!&quot;)... then &quot;Team Four Star Soda&quot;, which he says looks delicious, and is high in calcium. </Overview>

  <Overview>Nail finally stops flying with Frieza, claiming the land they are on is his people's sacred battleground. Frieza says it looks the same as everywhere else on the planet. After some racist remarks, Nail attacks him to no effect. Frieza grabs his arm and rips it off. Nail then surprises Frieza by growing it right back. Frieza rips the newly-grown arm off again.

In Frieza's ship, Vegeta loads Goku into a healing tank. He thinks the bubbles tickle, but laughing hurts. Vegeta tells Gohan and Krillin the tank is an older model. Where's the newer one? He says he &quot;blew it the f*ck up&quot;. He tells the Earthlings to strip. After a moment of hesitation, he tells them he has battle armor for them, which Krillin thinks is less awkward. As they change, Krillin thinks it feels like they've been on Namek for a year, when it's only been six days. He then says his armor looks familiar, and asks Vegeta who the other Saiyan with him on Earth was. He starts repeatedly saying &quot;Vegeta? Vegeta?&quot; making the tired Vegeta hallucinate and think it's Nappa. He responds, &quot;Goddamn it, Nappa&quot;, which Krillin takes as the name. Krillin thinks they should get Little Green to summon the dragon, but thinks it's a long way to go. Gohan gets him to go anyway. Vegeta tells Krillin not to get killed, God forbid that make him happy. Vegeta decides to take a nap, and tells Gohan to guard the ship. He says not to stray far, wanting his &quot;meat shields&quot; close by.

As Goku deals with the pain of his injuries, King Kai calls in. He starts describing his battle with the Ginyu Force in inadvertently suggestive terms. George Takei, who was listening in, gets titilated by what he turned into a three-way call. Back in their battle, Nail's had his arm ripped off 24 times. He tries to blast Frieza, but that does nothing either. Frieza asks him if he's heard of Planet Vegeta. Nail responds &quot;No&quot;, exactly what Frieza wants to hear when he asks someone about Namek. He whacks Nail in the face, and starts laughing, finding satisfaction in doing &quot;grunt work&quot; himself. Surprisingly, Nail laughs, too. It turns out, he's been distracting Frieza while Dende went to the Earthlings with the password for the Dragon Balls. Frieza flies off in a rage, also finding the Ginyu Force are all dead when he looks for them on his scouter.

While flying back to the others, Dende is stopped by a silhouetted person in Saiyan armor yelling, &quot;Stop right there, Namekian scum!&quot; It was Krillin, pulling a joke, one Dende didn't find funny. Back at the ship, Gohan ponders his lot in life, how his only friends are &quot;a 26-year-old dwarf and a giant green alien who constantly hits me&quot;. Then again, unlike his dad, at least they're around. Krillin arrives with Dende, and tells Gohan about a plan to get the Dragon Balls and make their wish before Vegeta wakes up. Krillin thinks it's a better chance. Gohan tells him &quot;Team Three Star&quot; was not a great name idea; oddly, Krillin agrees. They fly a distance away with the Dragon Balls. As they get settled, they sense Frieza approaching, so Dende summons their dragon, Porunga, who Krillin describes as &quot;on steroids&quot;. Porunga mistakes Krillin for an &quot;albino Namekian&quot;, which should've been all purged; Dende says they're just annoying Earthlings.

Porunga tells them they get three wishes. As they prepare to wish, King Kai's voice is heard in Krillin's head. Dende asks if it says his name right. King Kai begs Krillin to get the Z Fighters off his planet before he tries to kill himself. Porunga, however, tells them he can only resurrect one at a time. Piccolo gets an idea: wish only him back. That way Kami returns, and they can resurrect the others with the Earth Dragon Balls. Krillin tells Dende to wish Piccolo back to life, and beam him to Namek. Piccolo's pleas not to fall on deaf ears, and suddenly he is heard screaming on the opposite side of Namek. Dende says he didn't appear before them because they didn't say where on Namek they wanted him to appear. Gohan compares the rule to a &quot;monkey's paw&quot;, prompting Piccolo to yell &quot;NERRRRRRRRRRRRD!&quot;

Vegeta is woken up by the energy of Piccolo showing up, and first has to pee. Then he notices it's night...on a planet with three suns. When he figures out what's going on, he curses. Before Krillin can use the last wish to get a hoagie sandwich, Vegeta appears. After a brief exchange with Gohan, he demands Dende give him his wish of immortality. Meanwhile, at Namek's lookout, Guru feels the dragon's presence, thinking, &quot;It would be a real dick move to die right now.&quot; Mid-wish, Porunga disintegrates and the Dragon Balls turn to stone. Dende reports that Guru is dead, and Vegeta didn't get his wish. Vegeta freaks out right before Frieza appears before them.

In the stinger, Kami reappears at his lookout to find Mr. Popo watering marijuana plants. But he has no intention of getting rid of it; it works wonders on his glaucoma. </Overview>

  <Overview>Following Krillin's death, Freeza laughs and taunts the enraged Goku, who transforms into a Super Saiyan. Freeza, now confused about the situation, begins to question Goku what happened to his appearance. Ignoring Freeza's questions, Goku tells Gohan to take Piccolo and Bulma to his ship and escape. However, Gohan is also confused, and worries about his father, who angrily repeats his command. Gohan, startled at the sudden change in his father, quickly takes the badly wounded Piccolo and flies to Goku's ship. Freeza then attempts to kill the fleeing Gohan, but is stopped by Goku, who in turn, snaps his hand, hits him away, and knees him in the abdomen. Freeza then fires multiple Death Beams at Goku, only for him to dodge all of them. Freeza, now beginning to feel afraid, questions Goku again, refusing to believe the Super Saiyan legend. Goku then says his &quot;I am&quot; speech to Freeza, but with comical twists to each sentence. Goku then begins to say that he is a Super Saiyan, but is interrupted when Freeza shoots another Death Beam to his face. Goku, unaffected by the attack, finishes his sentence, angering Freeza even more.

King Kai, speechless about the entire situation begins to stammer. Yamcha asks him what is happening, and King Kai reminds him that he could just touch his shoulder to see everything. Yamcha refuses, because of King Kai's bad odor. King Kai says that &quot;it's his natural musk&quot;, and then repeatedly says &quot;musk&quot;, much to the annoyance of Tien Shinhan.King Kai is then telepathically contacted by Kami, who informs him that Mr. Popo has started gathering the Dragon Balls, all according to his plan. Yamcha is then annoyed that he was not informed of such a plan, followed by King Kai saying, &quot;I don't have to tell you anything!&quot;. Tien then remarks how what King Kai just said was the summary of their whole time spent at King Kai's planet, meaning that being with King Kai was useless and wasted time

Gohan then finds Goku's ship, and lays down Piccolo's unconscious body. He then forgets that Bulma still needs to be rescued and wonders how to fly the ship. He then remembers by remembering who built the ship for Goku. Bulma is then shown hanging from a colapsing island, crying for help. The scene then shifts back to Goku and Freeza. Freeza admits that Goku has become stronger, but still believes that he will not lose to a Saiyan. He then says that he owns Planet Vegeta and Namek, but loses interest in Namek and proceeds to destroy the planet. Goku, who seemed to be angrily looking at Freeza and ignoring his questions, was actually staring off blankly into space, not paying attention to Freeza at all. But before Goku can bring himself back to his senses, Freeza's energy blast creates a huge explosion, shattering Namek's core.

King Kai, who at first appears to be lamenting the destruction of the planet, Goku and his friends, and his plan, actually is upset that he will stay with Tien, Yamcha, and Chiaotzu forever, because with the plan ruined, Guru would not come back to life, and the Namekian Dragon Balls wouldn't be able bring back the three to life. Tien then takes this as a joke, not knowing that King Kai was serious, but learns that he is. King Kai then says that Freeza had ruined his plan. Chiaotzu guesses the method that Freeza used: suicide bombing, because that is how he died. King Kai then says that this time, the method was a sucess. King Kai then again begins to lament his fate with Tien, Yamcha, and Chiaotzu, but is interrupted by Kami, who says that Mr. Popo has acquired the sixth Dragon Ball, and the plan is almost ready to execute. King Kai then realizes that if Kami is still alive, then Piccolo is still alive. If Piccolo is still alive, then Planet Namek has not been destroyed yet.

Goku, noticing that the planet is still intact, asks Freeza whether or not he missed the core. Freeza, believing that he had missed the core, blames it on stress. Goku blames the idea that Freeza chickened out, as he couldn't blow himself up along with his enemy. Freeza then reminds Goku that he could breathe in space, and that Goku couldn't, so it wouldn't matter when the planet exploded. Freeza then estimates that the planet has around five minutes untill it explodes, motivating Goku to kill Freeza quicker. Freeza then notices that he is still at half power, not enough to defeat Goku. Freeza then tries to bribe Goku by letting him power up for a pizza. Goku, enraged by this taunting decides to attack Freeza before he can power up, but gives in when Freeza says he will give Goku two pizzas with stuffed crust. King Kai then tries to persuade Goku not to let Freeza power up to 100%, but does not succeed, as Goku changes the subject to the pizzas. Freeza, now up to 100% full power, thanks Goku for waiting. Goku, who is still talking to King Kai does not hear what Freeza says and begins to ask Freeza to repeat himseld, but is interrupted when Freeza lands a heavy punch to Goku's stomach. Freeza then proceeds to rapidly attack Goku at close range, easily overpowering him.

Gohan, who is looking for Bulma, calls out for her name, and hears her screaming loudly like an animal. Gohan then rescues Bulma from the crumbling island and flies back to the ship. Bulma, angry that she was left alone and Gohan took so long to rescue her, says that she almost died. Gohan, annoyed at Bulma's complaints, states that she wouldn't have gotten hurt from the height she was hanging from. Freeza then tells Goku how easy it is to get away with doing bad things, refering to the situation in which most stories have antagonists doing evil acts while the protagonists just stand there and watch, not even attempting to stop it. Goku, still not paying attention, asks Freeza if his pizzas could be meat lovers. Angry that Goku is not taking the fight seriously, Freeza kicks him in the face. King Kai then wonders why he even bothered to train Goku if he wouldn't fight seriously, even when his best friend had been killed. Kami then informs King Kai that Mr. Popo has gathered all of the Dragon Balls, and states that all that King Kai sees him as is an updater. King Kai then requests to speak with Mr. Popo, but his antennas explode, due to the fact that Mr. Popo was high during the time.

Mr. Popo then summons Shenron, who asks Mr. Popo what his wish is, but stops talking when he realizes that the person who summoned him was Mr. Popo, his &quot;master&quot;. He then asks what his lord requested of him. Surprisingly, Popo did not know what he was supposed to do, and asked Kami what to do. Kami also did not know what Popo should do, and asks King Kai, revealing that King Kai never thoroughly explained to anyone what his plan was. King Kai then says to wish for the resurecction of all who were killed by Freeza. Kami asks why, and the two argue about questioning God, due to the fact that they are both Gods. Popo then commands Shenron to &quot;bring back all of the worthless maggots killed by Freeza and his men&quot;. </Overview>

Chiaotzu guesses the method that Freeza used: suicide bombing, because that is how he died. King Kai then says that this time, the method was a sucess. King Kai then again begins to lament his fate with Tien, Yamcha, and Chiaotzu, but is interrupted by Kami, who says that Mr. Popo has acquired the sixth Dragon Ball, and the plan is almost ready to execute. King Kai then realizes that if Kami is still alive, then Piccolo is still alive. If Piccolo is still alive, then Planet Namek has not been destroyed yet.

Goku, noticing that the planet is still intact, asks Freeza whether or not he missed the core. Freeza, believing that he had missed the core, blames it on stress. Goku blames the idea that Freeza chickened out, as he couldn't blow himself up along with his enemy. Freeza then reminds Goku that he could breathe in space, and that Goku couldn't, so it wouldn't matter when the planet exploded. Freeza then estimates that the planet has around five minutes untill it explodes, motivating Goku to kill Freeza quicker. Freeza then notices that he is still at half power, not enough to defeat Goku. Freeza then tries to bribe Goku by letting him power up for a pizza. Goku, enraged by this taunting decides to attack Freeza before he can power up, but gives in when Freeza says he will give Goku two pizzas with stuffed crust. King Kai then tries to persuade Goku not to let Freeza power up to 100%, but does not succeed, as Goku changes the subject to the pizzas. Freeza, now up to 100% full power, thanks Goku for waiting. Goku, who is still talking to King Kai does not hear what Freeza says and begins to ask Freeza to repeat himseld, but is interrupted when Freeza lands a heavy punch to Goku's stomach. Freeza then proceeds to rapidly attack Goku at close range, easily overpowering him.

Gohan, who is looking for Bulma, calls out for her name, and hears her screaming loudly like an animal. Gohan then rescues Bulma from the crumbling island and flies back to the ship. Bulma, angry that she was left alone and Gohan took so long to rescue her, says that she almost died. Gohan, annoyed at Bulma's complaints, states that she wouldn't have gotten hurt from the height she was hanging from. Freeza then tells Goku how easy it is to get away with doing bad things, refering to the situation in which most stories have antagonists doing evil acts while the protagonists just stand there and watch, not even attempting to stop it. Goku, still not paying attention, asks Freeza if his pizzas could be meat lovers. Angry that Goku is not taking the fight seriously, Freeza kicks him in the face. King Kai then wonders why he even bothered to train Goku if he wouldn't fight seriously, even when his best friend had been killed. Kami then informs King Kai that Mr. Popo has gathered all of the Dragon Balls, and states that all that King Kai sees him as is an updater. King Kai then requests to speak with Mr. Popo, but his antennas explode, due to the fact that Mr. Popo was high during the time.

Mr. Popo then summons Shenron, who asks Mr. Popo what his wish is, but stops talking when he realizes that the person who summoned him was Mr. Popo, his &quot;master&quot;. He then asks what his lord requested of him. Surprisingly, Popo did not know what he was supposed to do, and asked Kami what to do. Kami also did not know what Popo should do, and asks King Kai, revealing that King Kai never thoroughly explained to anyone what his plan was. King Kai then says to wish for the resurecction of all who were killed by Freeza. Kami asks why, and the two argue about questioning God, due to the fact that they are both Gods. Popo then commands Shenron to &quot;bring back all of the worthless maggots killed by Freeza and his men&quot;. </Overview>

  <Overview>Following Krillin's death, Freeza laughs and taunts the enraged Goku, who transforms into a Super Saiyan. Freeza, now confused about the situation, begins to question Goku what happened to his appearance. Ignoring Freeza's questions, Goku tells Gohan to take Piccolo and Bulma to his ship and escape. However, Gohan is also confused, and worries about his father, who angrily repeats his command. Gohan, startled at the sudden change in his father, quickly takes the badly wounded Piccolo and flies to Goku's ship. Freeza then attempts to kill the fleeing Gohan, but is stopped by Goku, who in turn, snaps his hand, hits him away, and knees him in the abdomen. Freeza then fires multiple Death Beams at Goku, only for him to dodge all of them. Freeza, now beginning to feel afraid, questions Goku again, refusing to believe the Super Saiyan legend. Goku then says his &quot;I am&quot; speech to Freeza, but with comical twists to each sentence. Goku then begins to say that he is a Super Saiyan, but is interrupted when Freeza shoots another Death Beam to his face. Goku, unaffected by the attack, finishes his sentence, angering Freeza even more.

King Kai, speechless about the entire situation begins to stammer. Yamcha asks him what is happening, and King Kai reminds him that he could just touch his shoulder to see everything. Yamcha refuses, because of King Kai's bad odor. King Kai says that &quot;it's his natural musk&quot;, and then repeatedly says &quot;musk&quot;, much to the annoyance of Tien Shinhan.King Kai is then telepathically contacted by Kami, who informs him that Mr. Popo has started gathering the Dragon Balls, all according to his plan. Yamcha is then annoyed that he was not informed of such a plan, followed by King Kai saying, &quot;I don't have to tell you anything!&quot;. Tien then remarks how what King Kai just said was the summary of their whole time spent at King Kai's planet, meaning that being with King Kai was useless and wasted time

Gohan then finds Goku's ship, and lays down Piccolo's unconscious body. He then forgets that Bulma still needs to be rescued and wonders how to fly the ship. He then remembers by remembering who built the ship for Goku. Bulma is then shown hanging from a colapsing island, crying for help. The scene then shifts back to Goku and Freeza. Freeza admits that Goku has become stronger, but still believes that he will not lose to a Saiyan. He then says that he owns Planet Vegeta and Namek, but loses interest in Namek and proceeds to destroy the planet. Goku, who seemed to be angrily looking at Freeza and ignoring his questions, was actually staring off blankly into space, not paying attention to Freeza at all. But before Goku can bring himself back to his senses, Freeza's energy blast creates a huge explosion, shattering Namek's core.

King Kai, who at first appears to be lamenting the destruction of the planet, Goku and his friends, and his plan, actually is upset that he will stay with Tien, Yamcha, and Chiaotzu forever, because with the plan ruined, Guru would not come back to life, and the Namekian Dragon Balls wouldn't be able bring back the three to life.
