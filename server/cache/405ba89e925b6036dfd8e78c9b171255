  <Overview>Deep within the core of the Earth a fire rages. Within the heart of this fire dwells the Eternal Dragon, a magical beast of limitless power that can be summoned from his fiery lair only when the seven magic Dragon Balls -- now scattered over the face of the Earth -- are found and brought together. When the seven magic Dragon Balls are united, the Eternal Dragon will appear before the adventurer who brought them together and grant that person a single wish. Then, once more the balls will be scattered to the four winds, and the dragon beast will return to his fiery lair until another brave or foolish soul rediscovers the balls and tries to bring them together again.</Overview>

When they arrive at the shore, the turtle tells them to wait for him. When he comes back, a man is riding on his back. The man is Master Roshi, and as a reward for helping his turtle, he gives Goku his flying Nimbus Cloud. Roshi himself can't ride the cloud, because only good and pure people can.

When Master Roshi returns to his island, he finds Emperor Pilaf and his two henchmen searching his house for the Dragon Ball.

Goku brings back a big ugly-looking girl but Master Roshi wanted a beautiful girl. So Goku got a mermaid, but it didn't go well. Suddenly, a small boy named Krillin paddles ashore on a boat and requests training from Master Roshi. With the help of a bribe, Master Roshi agrees to train him. He sends Goku and Krillin into the city to find him another girl. Meanwhile, Yamcha's ship crashed, so he, Bulma, Puar, and Oolong are forced to walk through the desert. </Overview>

  <Overview>Because Krillin can't sit on the Nimbus Cloud, he is forced to cling to Goku's back during their search for a girl. They find a girl being attacked by two men. Goku beats up these two guys, and they bring the girl back to Master Roshi's island. Unknown to either of them, the girl, Launch, was actually being arrested when they found her. When she sneezes, she turns into a mean, aggressive, blonde criminal. Back on the island, Roshi likes Launch so much that he agrees to take her on as a student, along with Goku and Krillin. Launch sneezes, and then takes out a machine gun and shoots at the three boys. After another sneeze, everything is back to normal. </Overview>

  <Overview>Master Roshi packs up his house in a dyno capsule, and the four of them head to a bigger island. Master Roshi tests the boys' speed by timing them in a 100 meter dash. Krillin goes first, and runs the distance in 10.4 seconds. Goku's time is 11 seconds, but after he takes off his old, beat-up shoes, he runs it in 8 seconds. Master Roshi dazzles them by running it in 5.6 seconds. Then he gives them their final test for the day. He makes a mark on a stone, then throws it into the woods, telling them to find it; the loser must go without dinner for the night. Krillin tries to fool Master Roshi with a stone of his own, but Roshi sees through the lie. Goku finds the stone, but Krillin steals it and runs away. Goku catches up, and the two of them fight. Goku wins, so Krillin throws a decoy stone back into the woods, and Goku runs after it, thinking it's the real one. Krillin takes the real stone back to Master Roshi. However, it ultimately turns out to be a pyrrhic victory for Krillin, as Launch made pufferfish for dinner and failed to properly prepare it. </Overview>

  <Overview>Master Roshi wakes the boys up early to begin their training. Their job is to deliver milk, but there are several miles between each house. After several exhausting runs, they are made to climb a mountain to deliver milk to the monk at the top. While at the top, Master Roshi tells them that in eight months, they will be competing in the 21st World Martial Arts Tournament. This encouraging thought is enough to drive Goku and Krillin through the end of their milk delivery. Once the delivery ends, Master Roshi tells them that they will be delivering milk every day until the tournament. The boys are shocked to find out that the milk delivery was only their early morning training, and that they have much more to do every day. Meanwhile, Yamcha is also training for the World Martial Arts Tournament. </Overview>

  <Overview>The boys continue their workout by plowing an entire field with their hands. After a quick breakfast, they head over to a construction site. Here, they dig holes and haul equipment. Their speed dazzles the foreman. They eat lunch and then take a nap. Goku is getting impatient, and wants to learn fighting moves, but Master Roshi says he won't teach them fighting moves until their bodies are in the proper condition. Their next task is to swim ten laps on a lake while they're being chased by sharks. Then Master Roshi ties them to a tree and makes them dodge angry bees. At the end of the day's training, Master Roshi tells them they will be doing the same thing every day for the next eight months, but with 50 lb. turtle shells on their backs. </Overview>

  <Overview>After several months of training, the boys are anxious to learn fighting techniques. Master Roshi tells them that he has no technique to teach them. The whole point of turtle hermit training is to get your body in superhuman condition. He says fighting is just the expression of your power. Then he gives them 100 lb. turtle shells to wear from now on. After a couple more months, the day before the tournament finally arrives. After everyone checks in, Yamcha, Bulma, Oolong, and Puar meet up with Goku. The next morning, Master Roshi gives Goku and Krillin fighting uniforms to wear. </Overview>

  <Overview>The preliminary rounds are divided into four sections, with the top two from each section going on to the finals. Goku and Krillin are drawn into the same section, but are on opposite ends, so they won't have to fight each other. Goku's first match is against a giant, but he is able to knock him out of the ring with only a slight tap to the leg. Krillin's first opponent is an enemy from his old martial arts school. He kicks his opponent so hard that he breaks a hole in the wall. Bulma, Oolong, and Puar are able to watch the matches through this hole. At the end of the day, Goku, Krillin, and Yamcha all advance to the final round of the World Martial Arts Tournament. </Overview>

The fight ends when Jackie Chun pushes Yamcha out of the ring with his energy. The third match between Nam and Ranfan begins. Nam is fighting for prize money to buy water for his village. Nam hits her and she starts to cry, but the crying is just an act. She takes advantage of this and quickly attacks. When Nam is able to defend her attacks easily, she takes off her clothes to distract him. Jackie Chun begins hooting wildly, and Yamcha recognizes this laughter as Master Roshi's. He realizes that Jackie Chun is Roshi. Nam closes his eyes and is able to beat Ranfan. </Overview>

  <Overview>Goku's match is postponed by rain. While they're waiting for the weather to clear up, they relax in the bar. Giran, Goku's opponent, comes in and starts causing trouble. Yamcha warns Goku that Giran has been known to cheat. When the match finally starts, Giran tricks Goku into dropping his guard, then punches him. Goku responds with a furious attack and throws Giran out of the ring. Giran reveals that he can fly, and he lands safely back in bounds. He then spits rock-hard gum onto Goku, paralyzing him. He throws Goku out of the ring, but Goku calls the flying Nimbus Cloud to save him. Just as Giran is about to punch Goku, his tail grows back and he dodges the punch. Since he is stronger with his tail, he is now able to break the gum. Shocked at this incredible display of strength, Giran forfeits the match. </Overview>

  <Overview>The first semifinal begins. Unfortunately, Jackie Chun's punches are too fast for Krillin to see. He attacks Jackie Chun, and after a brief instant, they fly away from each other. The announcer asks them to slowly reenact what happened. Jackie Chun tried to kick Krillin, but he dodged it and then tried to land a punch, but Jackie spit at him. Krillin countered this with his own spit. Then they played janken, which was just a distraction, allowing Jackie to kick Krillin in the face. After the reenactment, Krillin distracts Jackie with a pair of panties, then kicks him far out of the ring. Jackie uses a Kamehameha wave to blast himself back into the ring. Then he uses the after-image technique to distract Krillin, allowing him to land a powerful kick, which knocks Krillin out. After the match, Yamcha, thinking that Jackie Chun is Master Roshi, tries to pull his wig off, but can't. Even though it seems like Jackie Chun is Master Roshi, no one can prove it. </Overview>

  <Overview>Goku starts his semifinal match against Nam. He uses a tornado attack to push Nam out of the ring, but gets too dizzy before he can finish it. Nam then uses his aerial attack, which is supposed to leave the victim unconscious. Goku is somehow able to stand up afterwards, and jumps up in the air just like Nam. Once Nam lands, Goku kicks him out of the ring. Afterwards, Nam packs up to leave, but Jackie Chun stops him. He gives him a dyno capsule that can be used for storage. Nam asks Jackie how he knew about his water problem, and Jackie says that he read his mind. Nam realizes that Jackie Chun is Master Roshi, but Jackie keeps him quiet. He explains that he is fighting undercover to beat Goku and Krillin. He doesn't want them to know that they're already the strongest in the world. Nam then does Jackie a favor by dressing up like Master Roshi and standing in the crowd. Yamcha sees him, and no longer thinks that Jackie Chun is Master Roshi. </Overview>

  <Overview>The final match begins. Goku jumps up in the air, but Jackie Chun sees it coming and kicks him out of the ring. Everyone thinks that Jackie has won, but Goku flies back into the ring by spinning his tail like helicopter blades. Jackie challenges Goku to use the Kamehameha wave, and to his great surprise, Goku can do it just as well as he can. Jackie uses a double after-image to fool Goku. Goku counters with a triple after-image. Jackie then begins staggering wildly around the ring. With his unpredictable movements, he begins beating up Goku. Yamcha tells Goku that he's using the drunken boxing technique, so Goku counters with his crazy monkey attack. He runs around like a monkey, and Jackie Chun can't follow him. Once this is over, Jackie Chun says that his next move will win the match. </Overview>

  <Overview>Night begins to fall as the final match continues. Jackie Chun hypnotizes Goku and puts him to sleep. Goku can't wake up unless Jackie tells him to. Just before the count reaches 10, Bulma yells &quot;Goku! Your dinner is ready!&quot; and Goku wakes up. Then Goku uses janken attack moves, but Jackie defends them. Goku tricks him by saying &quot;paper,&quot; but throwing rock. Jackie decides to use an attack that he's only ever used once before: the Lightning Flash Surprise attack. He gathers his energy and shoots it at Goku. This energy is transformed into 20,000 volts when it hits Goku. Just as Goku is about to give up, he glimpses the moon, and transforms into a gigantic ape again. Knowing that he must stop Goku's rampage at any cost, Jackie Chun fires his most powerful Kamehameha wave. When the dust clears, it looks like Goku is dead. </Overview>

  <Overview>Jackie Chun actually fired the wave at the moon, not Goku. Goku is found sleeping in the rubble, so they wake him up to continue the match. Krillin lends Goku his clothes. Once the match resumes, Jackie Chun tries to fire another Kamehameha wave at Goku, but finds that he doesn't have the energy. Goku kicks him out of the ring, but Jackie avoids hitting the ground by sticking his foot inside the wall. With both of them completely exhausted, they on a straightforward finish to the match. After a long bit of fighting, Goku and Jackie jump and kick each other in the face, knocking them both down. The count goes past 10, so the rules say the first person to stand up and declare victory wins. Goku struggles to his feet and nearly finishes his victory declaration, but collapses. Then Jackie Chun gets up and declares victory. After the match, Jackie secretly takes off his disguise, and they all go out to eat. Goku eats so much that Master Roshi has to spend his entire $500,000 prize on the meal. </Overview>

  <Overview>Master Roshi tells Goku and Krillin to take a break from training for now, but Krillin still decides to go live with him. Goku sets off on his search for the four-star Dragon Ball. Meanwhile, Nam has arrived at his village with the water, but it is still not enough. The river has run dry, so Nam heads upstream to find the source of the disturbance. He is attacked by a dinosaur, but luckily Goku is swimming in a nearby lake and comes to rescue him. He and Nam continue upstream and find that a dam has been built. The monsters that live there refuse to tear it down. Their leader, Giran, recognizes Goku from the tournament. He says that he would tear it down, but it's too strong for them to break. Goku fires a Kamehameha wave at it, which is enough to destroy the dam. With the river replenished, everything seems okay, but a sandstorm suddenly kicks up and dries up the river again. Goku notices the lake he was swimming in before. This is the Roaming Lake, and it came to help the village. </Overview>

  <Overview>Goku stops at a lake for a swim. When he gets out, he finds that the dragon radar has been stolen. He picks up on the thief's scent and follows it to its source. The thief tells him that he sold the radar to an antique salesman in a nearby town. Goku locates the shop and finds his dragon radar there. He picks up a signal coming from the shop, so he turns around and sees Emperor Pilaf and Mai holding the four-star ball, having just bought it from this store. They are able to escape on their ship, but Goku follows them on the Nimbus Cloud. Back at the antique store, a mysterious military force has arrived looking for a Dragon Ball. The salesman gives them a four-star ball, but they recognize it as a fake. Pilaf's four-star ball was also a fake, but Goku doesn't yet know. The signal he picked up on was the six-star ball in a nest above the shop. A bird then flies away with the ball in its talons. </Overview>

  <Overview>Emperor Pilaf gives Goku the fake four-star ball, but Goku accidentally breaks it. The bird that had the six-star ball got eaten by a larger bird, and that bird got captured by the Ox King. Chi Chi thinks Goku is coming, and since she wants to marry him, the Ox King roasts the bird for a wedding feast. Emperor Pilaf's radar picks up the signal coming from Ox King's village, so Shu dresses up like Goku to get close enough to steal the ball. Goku follows his radar's signal and finds Chi Chi in a field picking flowers for the wedding. Back at the feast, suddenly the mysterious military force, the Red Ribbon Army, attacks the village, having followed the six-star ball's signal as well. Ox King tries to fight back, but gets captured. Pilaf snatches the Dragon Ball from inside the bird and takes off in his ship. Goku and Chi Chi notice smoke coming from the village, so they go to check it out. </Overview>

While Snow, Goku and Eighter head to Dr. Flappe, Murasaki (who has survived) stalks them. Before Dr. Flappe can get to work, Murasaki surprises him.

Despite procuring the dragon radar, Red is displeased with Blue and offers him the a second chance if he can defeat Mercenary Tao. Meanwhile Bora tells Goku the legend of the Korin Tower.

  <Overview>Goku fights Tao. Despite his best attacks, Goku takes a severe beating from Tao. A Kamehameha Wave has no effect on Tao, but it sears his outfit. Angered, Tao fires a lethal beam (Dodon Wave) from his finger on Goku. Tao takes the dragonballs and taunts Upa before making his leave. Tao heads to a town to get a new outfit,while Red tells him that he is one dragonball short. Upa has buried his father and is about to bury Goku when an RR pilot lands. As the pilot tries to take the dragonball Goku kept, Goku beats him and blasts his jet. Apparently Goku's grandfather's dragonball blocked the Dodon Wave. Not knowing what to do next, Upa suggests that Goku tries to climb the Korin Tower. Goku makes a good start, while Tao waits for his outfit to be tailored to Red's frustration. The tower is indeed a lot higher than Goku thought and he nearly falls off but continues his long journey without giving up. </Overview>

  <Overview>In his first match of the preliminaries, Goku coincidentially gets one of the most dangerous opponents in the world, King Chappa. He is said to be the single greatest warrior of his time, once winning the World Martial Arts Tournament without his opponents laying a single hand on him! Goku has an uncanny smirk, not affected by the rumors.
Ready! Set! Go! Goku gets in the first punch and has King Chappa eating his words. It seems Goku is no ordinary child. Things heat up and the two show no mercy. Finally, one of Goku's combos get through and knock the legendary King Chappa down. But judging from his angry roar, he isn't happy!!! King Chappa is about to use his pantented eight-handed technique. Nicknamed, for it is so quick-his onslaught appears to be comprised of eight hands! But Goku dodges and counters every one of those eight hands quicker than he can throw them. He smirks once more and trips him with his tail. Goku takes to the air and King Chappa prepares to attack.

Then, Chiaotzu comes along and Krillin gives him a piece of his mind. &quot;&quot;Are you going to say something or what?&quot;&quot;(Honestly, I understand. Chaiotzu never says a word!)&quot;&quot;Baldy!&quot;&quot; replies Chiaotzu. WHAAAAAAT?!, the insulted Krillin yells. &quot;&quot;It's not exactly like you have a lion's maine under there, cueball!&quot;&quot;(If anyone watched this ep. closely enough I may have words slighty off. So, if you can, send me the exact quotes in the viewer's comments. thanks)Not exactly, says Chiaotzu. He removes his hat only to reveal.......there's only ONE SQUIGGLY HAIR under there!!! Tien shelters Chiaotzu as if he were his older brother telling him to put his hat back on before he catches a cold. Like Tien actually has a sensitive side to him!

  <Overview>Tambourine arrives to exact revenge on the murderer of his 'brother' Cymbal.  Goku tells Yajirobe that it is his turn to fight, and Yajirobe consents, as long as he can eat the monster.   Tambourine laughs and can't believe that Goku wants to challenge him again.  Goku says that he'll win this time because he is full and not hungry.  Goku then beats the living tar out of Tambourine.  Tambourine appears dead, but gets up and fires an energy ball at Goku.  It appears to have incinerated Goku, but Goku was too fast for it.   Tambourine tries to fly away, but Goku uses his power pole to propel himself upwards and powers up a Kamehameha.  He then incinerates Tambourine.   King Piccolo feels Tambourine's death through his mental link and goes to avenge his death himself.  The episode ends as Pilaf's airship appears in the skies above Goku and Yajirobe.</Overview>

Tien seems to be a lot stronger than Tao and tries to escort    him out of the ring until Tao takes off one of his cybernetic hands revealing a knife. The announcer tells Tao that he is disqualified for using a weapon but Tao dosen`t lisen because he wants to kill Tien for deciding to join the Turtle Hermit`s students. Tien breaks the knife. Tao takes off his other hand revealing a cannon for his super Dodon ray. Tao shoots the super Dodon ray at Tien. Tien survives the ray easily by being able to destroy it. Tien punches Tao in the stomach. Tien gives Tao to Shen. Shen and Tao leave the tournament saying that the Turtle Hermit and his students won`t die in peace.

  <Overview>Goku battles the unknown girl, who seems to be getting more and more angry at him.  Eventually, she tells him why she's angry at him:  Goku told her he'd marry her!  After a funny scene in which Goku finally learns what getting married means, he tells her he doesn't even recall saying this to her.  She then tells him that she'll tell him who she is, but only if he defeats her.  With that said, Goku easilly knocks her out of the ring.  Defeated, the girl reveals that she's Chi Chi(which Oolong already figured out).  Goku then realizes that he did promise to marry her, but he admits that he always thought that &quot;&quot;married&quot;&quot; was some sort of food.  Chi Chi is sad, but then is overjoyed when Goku proposes to her right in the ring.  She then kisses him(which makes Krillin angry).  Soon, the next battle begins:  Ma Junior(Piccolo) vs. Krillin.  The two seem to be even, but Piccolo decides to show Krillin some of his true strength...</Overview>
