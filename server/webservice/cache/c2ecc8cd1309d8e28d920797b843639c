  <Overview>Long ago, Bardock, a Saiyan warrior died in an attempt to stop Freeza, a galactic tyrant who ruled over the vast reaches of space. But before Freeza destroys Bardock's home planet, one space pod seems to have escaped only moments beforehand. Kakarrot, Bardock's son, had escaped the planet's explosion and was sent to Earth to follow through with Freeza's orders of conquering it. Upon crash landing on Earth, however, Kakarrot is found by an elderly man, Son Gohan, who raises him as his own, naming him Son Goku. Years pass and Goku ends up serving as Earth's greatest protector, completely unaware of his Saiyan heritage. But it seems that Goku is not the only survivor of his home planet, as another Saiyan has reached Earth to remind him of his true purpose. </Overview>

  <Overview>Goku, Krillin, and Gohan are in the hospital recovering from the battle with Vegeta. Their friends and family come visit. When the television is turned on, they see a report about Nappa's Space-Pod. Bulma, thinking she's pressed the button that will have it fly towards them, instead self-destructs the pod. Before everyone gives up hope, Mr. Popo arrives, and tells them that he knows of another spaceship. It's the Namekian ship that Kami used to come to earth when he was a boy. Bulma reluctantly agrees to inspect it up in Yunzabit Heights with him. They realize the craft is voice-activated in the native Namekian language. Bulma converts the language to english in a few weeks with Gohan and Krillin deciding to accompany her on her journey to planet Namek in search for the Dragon Balls. </Overview>

  <Overview>While on their journey to Namek, Gohan and Krillin practice image training. Meanwhile, Vegeta has landed on Planet Frieza No. 79, and after being revived, heads to Namek to collect the Dragon Balls once Kui tells him Lord Frieza is currently there. After 30 days aboard Kami's old space-vessel, Bulma, Krillin, and Gohan arrive on Namek. Bulma uses her scouter and notices that four of the seven dragon balls are together already. Gohan senses evil ki, but Bulma reassures them that the Namekians probably are the ones who have them. They notice Vegeta's spacepod fly overhead and land in the distance, along with a second spacepod shortly after. Vegeta isn't too thrilled to find out Zarbon and Dodoria are also accompanying Frieza. </Overview>

The Ginyu Force beats them there, and with speed and a time freeze, swipe the two remaining Dragon Balls. Captain Ginyu takes the seven Dragon Balls to Frieza, and allows the other members to play Rock-Paper-Scissors to decide who gets to fight who. Recoome wins a fight with Vegeta and Guldo wins a fight with Krillin and Gohan. Krillin and Gohan fight Guldo first. After proving that they are no easy match for him, Guldo paralyzes the two with his ESP. Vegeta kills Guldo before any harm is done to the Earthlings, so Recoome decides he's next to fight. Meanwhile, Goku is ten minutes from landing on Namek.</Overview>

  <Overview>Goku powers up to his maximum level - which is far greater than that of even Captain Ginyu! Yet, for some strange reason, Goku's current enemy doesn't seem too worried. After the Eldest Namek gives Dende a mysterious new power and sends him off to meet the Earthlings, Nail begins battling Frieza. While Frieza is clearly the stronger of the two, he is surprised at Nail's ability to regenerate lost limbs. Gohan and Krillin rescue Bulma from a dinosaur attack, and take the Dragon Radar to find where Frieza took the Dragon Balls to. As the episode ends, Ginyu makes the strange move of wounding himself, and firing a strange beam at Goku.</Overview>

  <Overview>After killing Jeice, Vegeta sets his sights on Ginyu (still in Goku's body.) Vegeta effortlessly pummels Ginyu, and an attempt by Ginyu to get Vegeta's body is thwarted by Goku who intervenes - ending up back in his own (wounded) body, and Ginyu going back to the body he had before - which he had deliberately wounded. Vegeta begins thrashing Ginyu in his native body, and once again quick thinking on Goku's part prevents Vegeta from being swapped with Ginyu's body - Goku throws a Namekian frog in the path of the beam, trapping Ginyu in the frog's body. Vegeta places Goku in a rejuvenation chamber inside Frieza's spaceship and gives armor to Krillin and Gohan - knowing an inevitable battle against Frieza is in their future. Vegeta begins sleeping to regain strength he lost while fighting Ginyu. Meanwhile, Nail continues to fight Frieza and does no damage to the tyrant. Once beaten and fallen, Nail reveals the truth - the fight was just a diversion to get the password to use the Dragon Balls to the Earthlings! Frieza begins charging back towards his spaceship, noticing his scouter no longer shows the power levels for the Ginyu Force. Krillin, Gohan, and Dende take the Dragon Balls, and Dende uses the password to summmon Porunga, the Namekian Dragon Balls' equivalent of Shenron.</Overview>

  <Overview>Porunga, the Namekian Eternal Dragon, is summoned. However Krillin, Gohan and Dende are met with some bad news when they discover that only one dead friend can be resurrected per wish! Piccolo communicates with the Earthlings, telling them to revive him and wish him to the Planet Namek. Dende speaks the first wish and Piccolo's halo disappears - and Kami is resurrected on Earth, much to Mr. Popo's joy. The second wish is made, however, Piccolo is nowhere in sight. Dende tells them that they wished him to the Planet Namek and not their specific location, however - so the third wish can be used to transport him to that particular spot. Unfortunately, things take a turn for the worst. Vegeta is awakened by sensing the approaching Frieza's power, and quickly awakens and rushes to where the Earthlings are making their wishes. He threatens them for stealing his chance at immortality, though they accidentally reveal that there is one more wish left - which he would be able to use to get immortality. He tells Dende to make him immortal, and with Frieza fast approaching, Krillin reluctantly tells Dende to wish Vegeta immortal - stating that, if nothing else, he is at least better than Frieza. Before he can deliver the wish, however, the Eldest Namek dies, causing the Dragon Balls to stop working. Vegeta is outraged at the Earthlings since his chance for immortality has one again been foiled. His anger at the Earthlings doesn't last, however, since Frieza arrives at the battlefield at that very moment. The tyrant begins charging up, terrifying everyone but Vegeta who seems strangely calm. The entire planet begins to shake violently as Frieza summons his power - as Goku remains in the rejuvenation chamber, slowly still recovering from the injuries his body had taken during the earlier Ginyu conflict.</Overview>

  <Overview>Piccolo arrives on Planet Namek following being resurrected and wished there. He begins rushing towards the battlefield, and along the way encounters an ailing Nail, on the brink of death. Piccolo reluctantly performs Namekian fusion with Nail, which increases his power substantially, and begins rushing back to the battlefield. Meanwhile, Frieza, after battling the Earthlings and Vegeta in his first form, transforms to his second form following some goading from Vegeta - and this increases the tyrant's power level to over a million! With his increased power, Frieza charges at Krillin in the air, impaling him on his horn.</Overview>

  <Overview>While Goku continues to recover in the rejuvenation chamber at Frieza's ship, Piccolo begins battling Frieza himself - and surprisingly manages to hold his own! The two exchange blows pretty evenly for a good portion of the fight. Piccolo realizes Frieza slightly holds the upper hand, so he removes his weighted clothing and begins winning against the tyrant. Frieza finds himself backed into a corner, so he decides it is best to transform again to fight Piccolo. Becoming his grotesque, ugly third form, Frieza once again gains the upper hand and begins obliterating Piccolo with a rapid finger beam blast. Gohan rushes to rescue his mentor, and when Krillin tries to follow suit, Vegeta stops him - revealing to Krillin he may have a strategy that will allow him to defeat the tyrant. </Overview>

  <Overview>Frieza dodges Gohan's attack but quickly finds himself on the receiving end once again - the young half Saiyan unleashes a massive energy blast that even the tyrant himself has difficulty deflecting! Upon seeing what he is up against in the form of these warriors who seem to be getting progressively stronger, Frieza begins transforming to his fourth form - the final and most powerful. Vegeta's plan to defeat Frieza involves having himself mortally wounded and then being healed by Dende - which the Saiyan prince achieves by having Krillin shoot an energy blast through his chest. Dende has no interest in healing Vegeta (who harmed so many of his people), however, and flies over to heal Piccolo instead. However, Nail's essence within Piccolo tells him that healing Vegeta may be the only way to win the fight - so Dende reluctantly does so. Frieza eventually reaches his final form, and immediately kills Dende with an energy blast - having witnessed his healing abilities while transforming. Krillin, Gohan, and Piccolo go on the attack but the tyrant dodges every single attack they throw his way. Vegeta watches them fight from a hill, preparing to charge up to his newfound power level as Gohan finds himself on a direct collision course with another one of Frieza's blasts.</Overview>

  <Overview>As the battle continues, it seems neither warrior is going to win before Namek's explosion. However, Goku soon notices that Frieza's power is quickly decreasing, due to the protracted battle wearing him out. Eventually, Goku decides to call it quits and begins to depart towards his spaceship. Unable to accept this, Frieza launches a pair of heat-seeking energy disks at Goku. The Super Saiyan manages to avoid this, however, and eventually Frieza is sliced in half by his own attack.</Overview>

  <Overview>On Earth, Guru finally passes, but before his death, he gives his power to the Namekian Moori, making him the new Elder. Meanwhile, on Namek, the dying Frieza begs for mercy from Goku. Despite his better judgement, Goku cannot ignore Frieza's pleas for help and gives the tyrant some of his own energy before departing. However, Frieza lets his pride get the better of him and unleashes one final energy blast at Goku, but the Super Saiyan easily repels the blast right back at the tyrant and seemingly destroys Frieza. Goku then attempts to escape in Frieza's spaceship, but is unable to make it take off. Namek finally explodes and it appears that Goku perishes along with it.</Overview>

  <Overview>Following Planet Namek's destruction, King Kai informs Bulma and the others on Earth of Goku's apparent death, and that even though the Namekian Dragon Balls can resurrect Goku and Krillin, they will be brought back to where Namek used to be and die again. However, Vegeta comes up with the idea of using the Dragon Balls to first bring Goku and Krillin's souls to the Earth's check-in station in the afterlife. 130 days later, the Namekian Dragon Balls are re-active, and the first two wishes are used to successfully revive Krillin, but it is revealed that Goku is still alive and that he will return to Earth on his own later. Yamcha is then brought back to life with the third wish. Another 130 days later, the Namekian Dragon Balls are used to revive both Tien and Chiaotzu, and are then used to teleport all of the Namekians (minus Piccolo) to a new planet. The Z Fighters then return to their peaceful lives, while waiting for Goku to return.</Overview>

  <Overview>After three hours of waiting, a space pod crash lands on Earth and Goku emerges from it. There is no time for celebration, however, as the mysterious teenager pulls Goku aside to talk with him in private. After testing Goku's Super Saiyan powers, the teenager reveals that his name is Trunks and that he comes from an apocolyptic future 20 years from the present, as well as that he is the future son of Bulma and Vegeta. He further informs Goku that in three years from now, a pair of deadly androids, built by Dr. Gero of the former Red Ribbon Army, will begin a rampage on Earth and kill all of the Z Fighters, except for Goku, who will die from a heart virus some time before their assault. Trunks then supplies Goku with a heart antidote that Future Bulma made for him, instructing him to take it when the virus attacks him. Goku promises that he and the other Z Fighters will train hard for the next three years to prepare for the androids' assault, and Trunks returns to the future in his time machine.</Overview>

  <Overview>The Z Fighters (plus Bulma with a young Trunks) gather at the island in anticipation of the androids' attack. However, as the time approaches, Gohan reasons that due to being artificial humans, their enemies have no readable ki and can therefore only be found visually. The fighters then descend into the nearby city to search out their enemies. After a period of searching, Yamcha becomes the first victim of the androids, after being impaled and having his energy absorbed by Android #20. The others arrive just in time to save him, and Goku eventually persuades the androids to move to a new location to fight after a large portion of the city is destroyed.</Overview>

  <Overview>As Goku, Piccolo and Tien take the androids to a new location to battle, Krillin revives Yamcha with a sensu bean. However, once Yamcha reveals the androids' ability to absorb energy, the three of them (Yamcha, Krillin and Gohan) head off to warn the others. Meanwhile, it is revealed to Goku that the androids are a result of years of research conducted by Dr. Gero, in which miniature spy robots were used to analyse Goku's fighting techniques and developments in strength, all in an attempt to exact revenge on Goku for destroying the Red Ribbon Army. As a battles ensues between Super Saiyan Goku and Android #19, it becomes evident that Goku is losing the upper hand, especially once the android absorbs Goku's Kamehameha wave. Gohan then reveals that Goku never became sick from the heart virus (as was predicted by Trunks), and that it seems to have affected him six months later than planned. As Goku struggles to fight, the android prepares to finish the battle by absorbing Goku's remaining energy.</Overview>

  <Overview>Before Android #19 can finish draining Goku's energy, Vegeta finally arrives, saving Goku by kicking the android in the face. Yamcha then escorts Goku away from the battlefield. Vegeta then squares up to the androids, and much to everyone's surprise, transforms into a Super Saiyan. It is revealed that whereas Goku's transformation was triggered by the desire to protect his friends and family, Vegeta's was triggered purely by the desire to become stronger, as well as his anger at being surpassed by Goku. The battle then begins, and it's clear that Vegeta has the edge over Android #19. Even the android's energy absorption attack proves futile, as Vegeta tears off the android's arms, making the technique impossible to use. As the android runs in fear, Vegeta launches his 'Big Bang Attack' and finishes the battle, leaving nothing but the android's head intact. Android 20 then escapes into the nearby cliffs, planning to use the terrain to launch a surprise attack on the fighters.</Overview>

  <Overview>The Z Fighters split up to search the area for Android #20. Frustrated at his enemy's deceptiveness, Vegeta fires a large ki blast at the cliffs, planning to level the area. Seeing this opportunity, Android #20 emerges from his hiding place, only to absorb Vegeta's blast and run away before Vegeta can catch up. He then attacks Piccolo from behind and begins to drain his energy, although this is thwarted by Gohan, who senses Piccolo's fading ki and attacks the android. After receiving a sensu bean, Piccolo then faces off against his attacker, and proves to be more than a match for the android. Meanwhile, Trunks finally returns from the future, and is disturbed to find that the remains of Android #19 are different from the androids that he faced in his own timeline. He then arrives at the current battlefield, and also seems not to recognise Android #20. Realising that he has no chance of victory, Android #20 decides to retreat to his laboratory, but not before launching a huge blast that engulfs most of the area - including Bulma's ship, which plummets towards the ground.</Overview>

  <Overview>As the dust settles, Android #20 is nowhere to be seen, and it is assumed that he plans to return to the laboratory and awaken Androids #17 and #18 - the androids causing havoc in Trunk's timeline. Meanwhile, Trunks rescues his mother and young self, and berates Vegeta for failing to protect his family. Bulma then reveals that Android #20 may actually be the androids' creator, Dr Gero, who has seemingly converted himself into one as well. The group then plan to find the lab and destroy the androids before Dr Gero can activate them. Vegeta also sets off to find the lab, but with the intentions of fighting the androids as a demonstration of his power. Trunks leaves to stop his father, while Piccolo finally unveils the truth of Trunk's origin to the rest of the group. Meanwhile, Piccolo, Krillin and Tien split up and search the mountains where Dr Gero's lab is rumoured to be located, while Gohan takes Bulma, baby Trunks and Yajrobe to Goku. Meanwhile, Krillin is attacked by the doctor, but is spared when Gero senses Piccolo nearby and escapes.</Overview>

  <Overview>Dr. Gero finally makes it to his laboratory, with Krillin in hot pursuit. Tien, Piccolo, Vegeta and Trunks soon locate him and break into the lab, although by this point Dr. Gero has already awakened Androids #17 and #18. Although initially appearing loyal, the duo demonstrate their independence when Android #17 destroys Gero's remote, ensuring that he cannot deactivate them should they disobey him, and Android #18 attempts to activate Android #16 - a fully mechanical model deemed a failure by Dr. Gero. Android #17 then kills Dr. Gero, by severing and then crushing his head. In an act of desperation, Trunks launches a large ki blast at the androids, hoping to destroy Android #16 before he is activated. Although the entire lab is decimated, both Androids and #16's pod remain intact, and he is awakened anyway. The trio then decide to carry out their initial orders, and set out to kill Goku. However, their plans are disrupted when Vegeta intervenes, challenging the three androids to a battle. After Android #16 refuses to fight, Android #18 steps up to face Vegeta.</Overview>

  <Overview>Back at Kami's house Chichi says that Goku is nearly healed. The monster uses the sting on his tail and starts sucking the life force out of a man which causes the man to melt away. The monster seems to know Piccolo's name and says that he is his brother. The others detect multiple Ki readings, seeming to come from many different people, including Goku, all gathered in one spot but everyone states that this is impossible and Gohan goes to check on Goku but he is still fast asleep in his bed. Krillin and Trunks start to head over to Gingertown meanwhile Piccolo and the monster starts fighting. The androids sense an atmospheric vibration and state that one of the power readings rivals Android 17's. The monster survives Piccolo's attack and then uses a Makankosappo  on him. Piccolo is shocked but deflects the attack. The monster says that the reason why Piccolo is beating him for now is because he has not achieved his 'perfect form' and the reason why he was sucking all life energy from the people in the town was to increase his own life energy. He also tells Piccolo that the person who sent him back into the time machine was himself;he had to revert himself back into egg form to fit inside the time machine. The monsters suprises Piccolo by using the Kamehameha  technique on Piccolo and then teleports behind Piccolo and starts sucking the life out of Piccolo's arm. Piccolo escapes with a shriveled arm by headbutting the monster in the head. The monster states that his name is Cell and that he is an android.</Overview>

  <Overview>Cell explains that he was born by the computer used by Doctor Gero. A long time ago Doctor Gero began collecting the cells of the greatest warriors to research how he could synthesize an android from these cells. However, because it was taking too much time, he gave up on it partway through but the computer continued its operation. Piccolo, Goku and Vegata's cells were collected at the battle when Vegeta first came to Earth. They also obtained Freeza and his father's cells when they came to Earth which explains all the different ki readings. A small spy robot, similar to Cell, was used to collect the cells while also collecting data and sending it to the computer but Piccolo destroyed it during the fight. Even though Doctor Gero's laboratory was destroyed, there was still a small room beneath the laboratory where the computer is. Cell furthermore explains how once he has turned back into an egg he requires three years underground to mature again and that he came back from the future because the absorption of human essence is not enough to achieve his perfect form; it is necessary for him to merge with two essential specialized life forms which the computer told Cell that they were the androids that Doctor Gero has created #17 and #18! In the future #17 and #18 weren't around but luckily Trunks had his time machine so he killed Trunks and came back to his era in search of #17 and #18. The reason why Cell chose this era was because Trunks's time machine already set for this era to warn the other about the androids so all Cell did was push the switch. The computer also told Cell that once he reaches his perfect form, he will have terrible power far greater than anymore imagined. After obtaining all of the information, Piccolo pulled off his shriveled arm and grew a new one. Just when Piccolo and Cell were about to fight Trunks and Krillin arrive. Realizing he has no chance of winning, Cell retreats by blinding them with Taiyoken and escapes to absorb more humans in the direction of Nickytown. Vegeta arrives at the scene and sees that the massive ki reading was Piccolo and when Tien finally arrives Piccolo explains to everyone what he has learnt from Cell. Meanwhile Cell is absorbing the life energy from passengers in a bus and plans to keep absorbing people till his power level is greater than #17 and the others and then he will make them merge with him for unimaginable power. </Overview>

  <Overview>Goku continues to train Gohan, who is still trying to achieve Super Saiyan form. Meanwhile Vegeta effortlessly pushes Cell around and beats him up. Cell curses at how if he was able to absorb Android #18 then he will become his perfect form and be able to defeat Vegeta easily even when he is in his Super Vegeta form. Cell persuades Vegeta into letting him absorb Android #18 because Vegeta would like to fight Cell in his perfect form as Saiyans love fighting. Not far away, Krillin decides not to destroy Android #18 with the emergency shutdown controller because he feels sorry for her how she used to be a human and also because she kissed him.</Overview>

  <Overview>As Piccolo completes his training in the Hyperbolic Time Chamber and Vegeta takes his place, Goku and Gohan are spending their days relaxing at home. Meanwhile, the Self-Defense Army attempt to launch an offensive strike against Cell, but they are completely wiped out. Hearing about this over the radio, Goku asks Picollo if it is possible to seperate with Kami, so he can use the Dragonballs to revive all the people Cell killed (as they disappeared since they fused together). Since Piccolo can't seperate, Goku theorises that he can convince another Namekian to stay on Earth and create a new set of Dragonballs, and goes to find King Kai so he can find the Namekians.</Overview>

  <Overview>Goku and Cell begin to fight and, despite putting on an impressive performance, Gohan and Vegeta both realise that neither is using his full power yet. Both fighters then raise their ki to their maximum. After a brief battle, Cell begins to attack using techniques 'inherited' from other characters--first Tien's Multi-Form technique, then Piccolo's Makankosappo, and finally Frieza's homing Destructo Disc. When Goku overcomes each of these techniques, Cell prepares a full-power Kamehameha capable of destroying the Earth. Goku diverts the attack away from the planet by taking to the sky, and then uses Instant Transmission to return to escape back to the ring.</Overview>

  <Overview>The battle between Goku and Cell continues, with the two fighters reaching a pace that is barely visible to most of the onlookers. Cell then decides to destroy the tournament ring, ensuring that their battle isn't ended by a ring out and can continue until one of them either dies or surrenders. The battle becomes even more intense, culminating with Goku flying high into the sky building up a powerful Kamehameha. Cell and everyone else states that Goku is bluffing, since from his position in the sky, such an attack would easily destroy the Earth. Goku then unexpectedly uses Instant Transmission to teleport in front of Cell and executes the attack point-blank. While the rest of the world celebrates what they believe to be Cell's ultimate defeat, Goku and company watch as Cell's remaining lower half rises and regenerates his missing parts. While the ki of both fighters has depleted considerably, the battle continues on.</Overview>

  <Overview>Gohan shows no willingness to fight, and explains to Cell his reason - whenever he is in battle, he loses control and goes in an all out rage. Unfortunately, this intrigues Cell, and so he decides to enrage the boy by inflicting enough pain to force him to unleash his true strength. After watching Gohan take Cell's punishment, #16 decides to intervene by grabbing Cell and activating the bomb within his own body. Unfortunately, Krillin reveals that while repairing him, Bulma removed #16's bomb, which renders his intervention futile. Cell quickly breaks free of #16's hold, causing his body to shatter - leaving only his head intact. When Cell realizes his attempts at physical intimidation are failing, he devises a plan to attack the ones that are closest to Gohan by spawning seven offspring - the Cell Jr.'s.</Overview>

Gohan then proceeds to take on all of the Cell Juniors, proving himself impervious to their attacks and effortlessly destroying them. He then throws the Senzu beans to Trunks, who distributes them to his injured comrades. Gohan now focuses his attention on Cell, and from the onset of the battle, it is clear that Gohan holds the advantage.</Overview>

  <Overview>Cell finally unleashes his full power against Gohan, but even at maximum strength his attacks have no effect on the Super Saiyan 2. After being easily bested in battle, Cell attempts to destroy Gohan and the Earth with a giant Kamehameha, but Gohan produces an even larger wave and deflects the attack with ease. As the rest of the fighters predict an easy victory, Goku recalls that even in the Room of Spirit and Time, Gohan displayed strength far beyond that of a normal Super Saiyan. He then tells Gohan to deliver the finishing blow to Cell, but Gohan insists that Cell must suffer first. Cell then utilises his bulked-up transformation, but the increase in muscle mass lowers his speed greatly and as a result none of his attacks connect with Gohan - who counters with a single blow to the stomach, causing Cell to regurgitate Android 18 and revert back to his semi-perfect form. As the fighters assume that this means victory for Gohan, Cell's body begins to expand to a gigantic size.</Overview>

  <Overview>Cell continues to charge his Kamehameha, and reveals that not only has he gathered enough energy to destroy the Earth, but he also now has the potential to destroy the entire solar system with this blast. Meanwhile, Vegeta apologises to Gohan for his recklessness. As Gohan and the others watch on in hopelessness, Goku contacts his son from the afterlife and tells him that even in his injured state he has the potential to defeat Cell. Reinvigorated, Gohan prepares a final, one-handed Kamehameha to repel Cell's blast. As the two warriors struggle to overpower each other, Piccolo, Tien, Yamcha and Krillin bombard Cell with ki blasts in a knowingly futile attempt to help, but are easily repelled. As Goku coaxes Gohan to release his full power against Cell, Vegeta returns to the battlefield and launches one final Big Bang Attack, which temporarily distracts Cell. Seeing the opportunity, Gohan finally releases his full strength and overpowers Cell's wave, obliterating Cell's body and and saving the Earth from destruction. Gohan has won and the Cell Games are finally over. </Overview>
