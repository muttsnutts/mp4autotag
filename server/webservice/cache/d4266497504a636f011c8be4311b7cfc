Inspired by the Star Wars Trilogy Special Edition, fan editor Adywan has created a breathtaking and powerful version of the film. Star Wars: Revisited not only fixes errors and technical limitations to the film that should have been made in the first Special Edition, but gives us a whole new vision for the movie, tying it to the rest of the Star Wars saga while correcting many of the excesses of the original Special Edition. Shots are re-mastered and restored, special effect shots are re-composited and whole new sequences are created, giving the viewer a taste of what the Special Edition could have been. Accompanied by a new Dolby Digital 5.1 soundtrack, Star Wars: Revisited provides an exciting new visit to a galaxy far, far away.","popularity":0.299,"poster_path":"/7x00BRJuCVfW3bFAN1ECId5aFXu.jpg","production_companies":[{"name":"Adywan","id":5502}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2008-03-02","revenue":572,"runtime":135,"spoken_languages":[{"iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Star Wars for the 21st Century.
